# Competitive Programming

Some of the programs I coded to train for IEEEXtreme and Google Code Jam. Most of them are classic programming problems or challenges found in websites like [CSAcademy](csacademy.com), [DMOJ](dmoj.ca) and [HackerRank](hackerrank.com)

## Problems

-   [Coin Change](https://github.com/AlecBp/competitive-programming/blob/master/CoinChange/src/coinchange/CoinChange.java)
-   [Longest Common Subsequence](https://github.com/AlecBp/competitive-programming/blob/master/LongestCommonSubsequence/src/longestcommonsubsequence/LongestCommonSubsequence.java)
